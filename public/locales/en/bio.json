  "short bio": "(born November 7, 1867 in Warsaw, died July 4, 1934 in Passy) - Polish-French scientist dealing with experimental physics and physical chemistry, double Nobel Prize winner - winner of the Nobel Prize in physics (1903) and chemistry (1911).",
  "bio first paragraph": "In 1891, Maria Skłodowska left the Kingdom of Poland for Paris to study at the Sorbonne (in the 19th century, women were not allowed to study in Poland); then she developed her scientific career there. She was the precursor of a new branch of chemistry - radiochemistry. Her achievements include: the development of the theory of radioactivity, techniques for separating radioactive isotopes and the discovery of two new elements - radium and polonium. On her initiative, research on the treatment of cancer with radioactivity was also carried out",
  "bio second paragraph": "She was awarded the Nobel Prize for the first time in 1903 - in physics, together with her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel, for research on the phenomenon of radioactivity discovered by Becquerel. She was awarded the second time in 1911 - in chemistry for the discovery of polonium and radium, the separation of pure radium and the study of the chemical properties of radioactive elements. He is one of only four people to have received the Nobel Prize more than once. Among them, she is one of two that received awards in various disciplines. Among the four, she is also the only woman and the only scientist honored in two different natural sciences. Despite her Polish nationality and sentiments for the country, she never received Polish citizenship.",
  "bio third paragraph": "Maria Skłodowska-Curie is the first woman to be buried in the Paris Pantheon in recognition of her scientific merits. With her husband Pierre Curie, she had two daughters who lived to adulthood: Ève Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie."

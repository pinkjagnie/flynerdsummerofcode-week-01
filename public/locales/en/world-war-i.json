  "world war short": "when World War I broke out, seventeen-year-old Irène and ten-year-old Ève were away from Paris and their mother. They were on holiday at l'Arcouest under the care of Maria's friends. Maria Skłodowska-Curie remained in Paris to guard the Radium Institute and the radium sample.",
  "world war paragraph": "The government has declared that the radium in the Radium Institute is a national asset and must be protected. The scientist took radium to Bordeaux during the war. Maria, unable to serve Poland, decided to serve France. She collected X-ray machines from Parisian laboratories and organized special trucks with equipment, the so-called „little Curies” (in July 1916, as one of the first women, she obtained a truck driving license to be able to drive these cars). These were pioneering activities in the field of health diagnostics. Thanks to her work and perseverance, it was possible to take X-rays in field conditions. Maria was accompanied by military doctors and Irène, who was training radiologist technicians with her mother. This activity saved many soldiers from certain death. She was also a member of the Swiss General Committee for Aid to War Victims in Poland.",
